# Debouncing
Debouncing is a technique in programming that helps improve the performance of web applications by controlling the frequency at which time-consuming tasks are triggered. If a task is triggered too often—like when a user types quickly or rapidly clicks a button—it can lead to performance issues. Debouncing provides a solution by limiting how frequently a function can be executed.

In JavaScript, debouncing is commonly used to enhance browser performance by ensuring that expensive operations (like complex calculations, API calls, or DOM updates) are executed only when necessary. JavaScript operates in a single-threaded environment, meaning it can only handle one operation at a time. When certain actions are triggered too frequently, such as during continuous scrolling or typing, it can overload the browser and cause sluggish performance.

# Throttling
Throttling is a technique that limits the frequency of function execution, allowing it to run at most once within a specified time interval. It’s used to optimize performance during events like scrolling, resizing, or clicking.

JavaScript throttling limits the frequency at which a function is executed, ensuring it runs at most once in a specified time interval. It’s useful for optimizing performance in scenarios involving rapid, continuous events like scrolling or resizing.
